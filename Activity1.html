                        Coding is the process of creating instructions for computers using programming languages. It involves writing, testing, and maintaining code to build software applications, websites, and other digital solutions.Coding is the process of creating instructions for computers to follow. It's essentially a language used to communicate
                        with machines. The uses of coding are vast and permeate nearly every aspect of modern life, from the websites and apps
                        we use daily to the complex systems that run our cars, hospitals, and financial markets.coding covers a wide range of applications, including game development, cybersecurity, scientific research, and
                        artificial intelligence. In essence, coding is a fundamental skill that enables the creation of the digital world around
                        us, and its importance continues to grow as technology advances.
